# Fuel Run 

I was given the challenge of creating of creating an original Hypercasual mobile game for Android in just one week. I successfully created a game where you must steer a fast car to avoid traffic cones and collect fuel cans - which are vital for continuing and which contribute to your total score.
One of the bigger challenges with this project was optimising the game so it would comfortably have at least 30fps on lower end mobile devices, which I achieved.
